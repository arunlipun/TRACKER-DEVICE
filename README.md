ðŸš€ Real-Time Location Sharing Project

I recently built a Real-Time Location Sharing System using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js.

ðŸ”¹ What it does

âœ… Multiple users can share their live location in real time.
âœ… My own deviceâ€™s location is shown as a blue marker.
âœ… Other usersâ€™ locations are shown as red markers.
âœ… If I open the app on both laptop and mobile:

On laptop â†’ I see my blue marker + my mobileâ€™s red marker.

On mobile â†’ I see my blue marker + my laptopâ€™s red marker.
âœ… All markers update instantly as users move.

ðŸ”¹ How it works

The Geolocation API fetches the deviceâ€™s latitude & longitude.

This location is sent to the backend using Socket.io.

The server broadcasts this data to all connected devices.

Leaflet.js displays the updated markers on the map in real time.
